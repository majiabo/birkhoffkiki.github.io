## Self description
I have rich practical experience in the application of computer vision in medical image analysis, and can use Python, C++ and other tools to develop and deploy algorithms. During my master's degree, I participated in the development of computer-aided cervical cancer diagnosis system and accumulated rich engineering experience. In addition, I am able to independently carry out academic research and I published a top journal IEEE TMI in the field of medical imaging.
